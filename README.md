# ASTRO WATCHLIST

Built for amateurs astronomers, the app is an easy way to browse whatâ€™s in the Messier catalogue and create your own watch list.
You can add object you've seen or you want to see, to help you plan your next field trip.
You can also add other object to your account but if you want to climb the leader board, only Messier objects count!
